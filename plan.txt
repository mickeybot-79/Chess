To move a piece, check if:
- the target cell contains an enemy piece,
- the target cell is being threatened by an enemy piece,
- the target cell is being defended by a friendly piece,
- a friendly piece can be defended from the target cell,
- the friendly piece to be defended is already being defended by another friendly piece,
- the friendly piece to be defended is being threatened by one or more enemy pieces,
- the piece to be moved can threaten an enemy piece from the target cell,
- the enemy piece that would be threatened from the target cell is also being threatened by another friendly piece,
- the enemy piece that would be threatened from the target cell is being defended by one or more enemy pieces

Also consider: 
- the value of the current piece,
- the value of the enemy piece being taken out,
- the value of the enemy piece being threatened
- the value of the enemy piece being defended
- the value of the friendly piece being defended
- the value of the friendly piece being left defenseless,

Remember: 
- Add second queen to allPiecePositions, allThreatenedCells and allPossibleMoves in the nextMove file.
